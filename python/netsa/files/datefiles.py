    Given a string (presumably the pathname to a file) with a date in
    it, return the directory of the file and the date/non-date
    components of the file name as an array. This routine is pretty
    liberal about what constites a valid date format since it expects,
    by contract, a filename with a date string embedded within it.

    For example, the input ``"foo/bar-20090120:12:17:21.txt"`` parses
    to::
    
      ('foo', ['bar-', 2009, None, 1, None, 20, ':", 12, ':', 17, ':', 21, '.txt'])

    The following are all valid dates::

      2008
      200811
      20081105
      2008/11
      2008/11/05
      2008-11-05
      2008.11.05
      2008-11-05:07
      2008-11-05:07:11
      2008-11-05:07:11:00

    Separators between year/month/day are 'non digits'. This implies
    that directories within the path string can contribute to the
    date along with information in the filename itself. The
    following is valid::

      '/path/to/2008/11/05.txt'
      
    The extraction is non-greedy: only the 'last' part that looks like a
    date is extracted. For example::

      '/path/to/2008/11/2008-11-05.txt'

    extracts only '2008-11-05' from the end of the string.

    Separators between hour/minute/sec must be ':'
