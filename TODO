 - Add section mechanism for netsa.script params, with explanatory text
   for each section.

 - Make params that are included in *without_params* be completely
   ignored by the flow_params parsing/checking mechanisms.  (So that,
   for example, flow_params could be used with --class, --type,
   etc. allowed as filtering options instead of file selection
   options.)
